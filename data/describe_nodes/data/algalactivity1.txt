  "C": "C represents conductivity in the water, which is an indicator of the water's ability to conduct electrical current, with '0' indicating low conductivity and '1' indicating high conductivity, often influenced by dissolved ions.",
  "Chl_a": "Chl_a stands for chlorophyll-a, a biological parameter used as a proxy for algal activity, where '0' represents normal levels below 5 µg/L and '1' represents elevated levels above 5 µg/L, indicating potential algal blooms.",
  "DO": "DO represents dissolved oxygen levels in the water, a critical factor for aquatic life, with '0' indicating low oxygen levels that may lead to hypoxia and '1' indicating sufficient oxygen levels for healthy ecosystems.",
  "N": "N refers to the concentration of nitrogen in the water, a key nutrient for algal growth, where '0' denotes low nitrogen levels and '1' denotes high nitrogen levels, which can contribute to eutrophication.",
  "P": "P symbolizes the concentration of phosphorus in the water, another essential nutrient for algae, with '0' representing low levels and '1' representing high levels that may promote algal blooms.",
  "Te": "Te denotes the temperature of the water, a physical parameter influencing algal growth rates, with '0' indicating lower temperatures and '1' indicating higher temperatures, which can accelerate algal activity.",
  "Tu": "Tu represents turbidity, or the clarity of the water, with '0' for low turbidity (clearer water) and '1' for high turbidity (murkier water), which can affect light penetration and algal growth.",
  "pH": "pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water, with '0' indicating lower pH (more acidic conditions) and '1' indicating higher pH (more alkaline conditions), which can influence nutrient availability and algal dynamics."
