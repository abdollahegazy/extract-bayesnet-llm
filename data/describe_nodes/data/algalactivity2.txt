{
  "C": "C represents conductivity in the water, which is an indicator of the water's ability to conduct electricity and reflects ion concentration; it can assume values '0' for low conductivity and '1' for high conductivity.",
  "Chl_a": "Chl_a stands for chlorophyll-a, a biological parameter used to indicate the presence of phytoplankton and algal activity; it can be '0' for concentrations below the threshold of 5 µg L–1 and '1' for concentrations above this threshold, signaling increased algal activity.",
  "DO": "DO represents dissolved oxygen levels in the water, which are critical for aquatic life; it can be '0' for low oxygen levels and '1' for high oxygen levels.",
  "N": "N refers to the concentration of nitrogen in the water, a key nutrient influencing algal growth; it can be '0' for low nitrogen levels and '1' for high nitrogen levels.",
  "P": "P represents the concentration of phosphorus in the water, another essential nutrient for algae; it can be '0' for low phosphorus levels and '1' for high phosphorus levels.",
  "Te": "Te denotes the temperature of the water, which affects algal growth and metabolic rates; it can be '0' for lower temperatures and '1' for higher temperatures.",
  "Tu": "Tu represents turbidity, or the clarity of the water, which can affect light penetration and algal growth; it can be '0' for low turbidity (clearer water) and '1' for high turbidity (murkier water).",
  "pH": "pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water, which influences nutrient availability and algal activity; it can be '0' for lower pH (more acidic) and '1' for higher pH (more alkaline)."
